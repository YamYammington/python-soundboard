# python-soundboard
A simple soundboard written in Python.

It reads WAV, MP3, or MIDI files, which need to be located in ./sfx
This and other required directories/files will be created automatically created when you run the program.
You must enable the Stereo Mix audio device in order to use the recorder function.

(It is recommended to use this program in combination with VB Audio Cable and Voicemeeter to play audio through the microphone. In the final version this will hopefully not be required.)

This program uses a modified version of system_hotkey (https://github.com/timeyyy/system_hotkey)
