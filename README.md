# python-soundboard
A simple soundboard written in Python.

It reads WAV, MP3, or MIDI files, which need to be located in ./sfx

Run the script to automatically create the directory.

Use the .pyw file if you want to run the script without a console (only on windows).

(It is recommended to use this program in combination with VB Audio Cable and Voicemeeter to play audio through the microphone)
